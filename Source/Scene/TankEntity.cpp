// Additional technical notes for the assignment:
// - Each tank has a team number (0 or 1), HP and other instance data - see the end of TankEntity.h
//   You will need to add other instance data suitable for the assignment requirements
// - A function GetTankUID is defined in TankAssignment.cpp and made available here, which returns
//   the UID of the tank on a given team. This can be used to get the enemy tank UID
// - Tanks have three parts: the root, the body and the turret. Each part has its own matrix, which
//   can be accessed with the Matrix function - root: Matrix(), body: Matrix(1), turret: Matrix(2)
//   However, the body and turret matrix are relative to the root's matrix - so to get the actual 
//   world matrix of the body, for example, we must multiply: Matrix(1) * Matrix()
// - Vector facing work similar to the car tag lab will be needed for the turret->enemy facing 
//   requirements for the Patrol and Aim states
// - The CMatrix4x4 function DecomposeAffineEuler allows you to extract the x,y & z rotations
//   of a matrix. This can be used on the *relative* turret matrix to help in rotating it to face
//   forwards in Evade state
// - The CShellEntity class is simply an outline. To support shell firing, you will need to add
//   member data to it and rewrite its constructor & update function. You will also need to update 
//   the CreateShell function in EntityManager.cpp to pass any additional constructor data required
// - Destroy an entity by returning false from its Update function - the entity manager wil perform
//   the destruction. Don't try to call DestroyEntity from within the Update function.
// - As entities can be destroyed, you must check that entity UIDs refer to existant entities, before
//   using their entity pointers. The return value from EntityManager.GetEntity will be NULL if the
//   entity no longer exists. Use this to avoid trying to target a tank that no longer exists etc.
